## Version 0.2.0

- Thanks to [@tony-kuo](https://github.com/tony-kuo), the package now includes a built-in dataloader for the pytorch-lightning framework,
for single cells expression profiles, training labels, and study labels. The dataloader uniformly samples across training labels and study labels to create a diverse batch of cells.

This is the first release of the package to support both creation and access to large
collection of files based on TileDB.
